Murphy\'s in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That\'s awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let\'s move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I\'m out! I can\'t believe I\'m out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It\'s got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It\'s a little bit of magic. That\'s amazing. Why do we do that? That\'s pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I\'m picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don\'t we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You\'re reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don\'t know, but I\'m loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It\'s a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama\'s little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don\'t think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you\'re about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There\'s a bee in the car! - Do something! - I\'m driving! - Hi, bee. - He\'s back here! He\'s going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don\'t move, he won\'t sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan\'t fly in rain. Oan\'t fly in rain. Oan\'t fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don\'t need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It\'s fantastic. It\'s got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What\'s number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don\'t go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn\'t talk to them. They\'re out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they\'re flabbergasted, can\'t believe what I say. There\'s the sun. Maybe that\'s a way out. I don\'t remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don\'t kill him! You know I\'m allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I\'m just saying all life has value. You don\'t know what he\'s capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I\'m not scared of him. It\'s an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It\'s a bee law. You\'re not supposed to talk to a human. I can\'t believe I\'m doing this. I\'ve got to. Oh, I can\'t do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can\'t. How should I start it? \"You like jazz?\" No, that\'s no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I\'m sorry. - You\'re talking. - Yes, I know. You\'re talking! I\'m so sorry. No, it\'s OK. It\'s fine. I know I\'m dreaming. But I don\'t recall going to bed. Well, I\'m sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you\'re a bee! I am. And I\'m not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn\'t for you... I had to thank you. It\'s just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I\'m talking with a bee. - Yeah. I\'m talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I\'m grateful. I\'ll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. \"Mama, Dada, honey.\" You pick it up. - That\'s very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn\'t laugh, we\'d cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don\'t know. I mean... I don\'t know. Ooffee? I don\'t want to put you out. It\'s no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It\'s just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don\'t be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn\'t. - Have some. - No, I can\'t. - Oome on! I\'m trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don\'t help. You look great! I don\'t know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He\'s making the tie in the cab as they\'re flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, \"Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?\" Is that a bee joke? That\'s the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don\'t know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can\'t do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There\'s my hive right there. See it? You\'re in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I\'m right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It\'s like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I\'ll try that. - You all right, ma\'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it\'s no trouble. Sorry I couldn\'t finish it. If I did, I\'d be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I\'ll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can\'t possibly work. He\'s all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can\'t believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don\'t. - How\'d you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I\'m glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your \"experience.\" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I\'m not attracted to spiders. I know it\'s the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can\'t get by that face. So who is she? She\'s... human. No, no. That\'s a bee law. You wouldn\'t break a bee law.', '2023-01-14 15:32:01', 0);

The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don\'t care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let\'s shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can\'t. I\'ll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I\'m excited. Here\'s the graduate. We\'re very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B\'s. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That\'s me! - Wave to us! We\'ll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I\'d make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I\'m glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I\'m not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don\'t waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That\'s why we don\'t need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it\'s just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it\'ll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She\'s my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we\'re all cousins. - Right. You\'re right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it\'s done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you\'ll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn\'t know that. What\'s the difference? You\'ll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven\'t had one day off in 27 million years. So you\'ll just work us to death? We\'ll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! \"What\'s the difference?\" How can you say that? One job forever? That\'s an insane choice to have to make. I\'m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We\'re bees. We\'re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don\'t know. But you know what I\'m talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I\'ve never seen them this close. They know what it\'s like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don\'t come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You\'re monsters! You\'re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don\'t know. Their day\'s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can\'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That\'s more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It\'s just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you\'re wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren\'t they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let\'s have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I\'d knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn\'t it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We\'re hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you\'re not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We\'re going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you\'re interested in? - Well, there\'s a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It\'s a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn\'t right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That\'s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son\'s not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I\'m not trying to be funny. You\'re not funny! You\'re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You\'re gonna be a stirrer? - No one\'s listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I\'m gonna get an ant tattoo! Let\'s open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I\'ll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody \"dawg\"! I\'m so proud. - We\'re starting work today! - Today\'s the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them\'s yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What\'d you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What\'s available? Restroom attendant\'s open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you\'re on. I\'m sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey\'s always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He\'s dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That\'s life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we\'ve got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I\'m going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You\'re gonna die! You\'re crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone\'s feeling brave, there\'s a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn\'t that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck\'s restricted. It\'s OK, Lou. We\'re gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, bi', NULL, '2023-01-14 15:23:44', 0),
